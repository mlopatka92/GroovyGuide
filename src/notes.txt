Groovy needs java.

Groovy has dynamically typed variables.

Everything in groovy is an object.

Groovyh decimal accuracy is pretty big.

There are different types of string - within a single quoute a text will be treated literally (without special values like \n) and within double quotes it will be handle variables.

In groovy we always pass parameters to functions as values.
